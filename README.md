# Off-center animation issue with react-remove-scroll

## How to reproduce

1. Run `npx esbuild --bundle index.tsx --outfile=index.js`
2. Open index.html
3. Open dev tool
   (TBH I'm not sure if it's necessary but I can get off-center icon more often for some reason)
4. Reload again and again until you get off-center icon
